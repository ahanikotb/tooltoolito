      "p1": "So you just deployed your first cryptocurrency token and now you're wondering how to calculate the initial price.",
      "p2": "The initial token price PancakeSwap is determined by the ratio at which you supply tokens to the liquidity pool.When you provide liquidity, you provide the 2 assets to which Pancakeswap will determine as equals. This should be your token and a certain amount of BNB/ETH or a stablecoin.Remember the token you’ve created has no value until the Liquidity Pool (LP) is provided hence it uses what you provide to determine the initial price."

      "p1": "Let’s say you provide 1000 BNB/ETH and 1000 of your token to create a liquidity pool for your token to be traded.To find the price for your token, divide the BNB/ETH or stablecoin amount by the token amount to get the token amount. then divide the token by the BNB/ETH or stablecoin to get the other side of the price.",
